## Client

You must look for a client that is trying a new methodology that mostly everybody has been using for years, but in reality they are just looking to be able to say that they are using said methodology.  It's crucial that the client feels like they are being left behind by not implementing this methodology but, even more importantly, the client must, and this is non negotiable, want to keep the existing processes while doing the new methodology too.

In other words, say they want to become a _devops shop_ here are the steps to accomplish this:

- Rename Ops team to DevOps Team

This has the advantage of being simple; as everybody knows exactly what they are supposed to be doing and how to do it, without any cultural changes or indeed technical changes, so this is a self evidently a win-win-win situation.

Furthermore, you want a client that is pretty inflexible vis-a-vis remote working so that everybody must be in the same building but crucially not in the same room or indeed the same floor so that most communications still happens via Slack/Teams but everybody has to commute to the office.

This is good for two reasons:

- The client can know whether they are getting value for money by what they can see, e.g. developers working late every day. 
- The client can more effectively manage the relationship by endlessly bike shedding.

If the building is not open 24 hours a day then so much the better because when the proverbial hits the fan and people have to work late, they literally can't do it from the office.


## Technical Design Authority

It's important that you select somebody with deep Resume (CV) FOMO, a lack of understanding of the design s/he is pushing forward and an inability to take decisions. Admittedly, the first two are likely to go hand in hand but if you can get the trifecta then you are well on your way to failure.

Furthermore, if you can also get the senior team members to undermine the TDA as often as possible then you are home and dry.

Even better if the undermining comes from a similar position of ignorance and is not backed by any experience.

## Tech Lead

You must look for somebody that has been through the wars so that s/he is very cynical, has a lot of lessons learnt from other projects in the same capacity, which will be applied regardless of applicability and, this is non-negotiable, absolute adherence to OOP dogma.

Uncle Bob is GOD and SOLID is Gospel, which as its name indicates, must not be questioned under any circumstance, anything that even smells of Functional Programming must be nipped in the bud, except when introduced by said Tech Lead, in which case it's not FP but common sense.

Code Coverage is not an arbitrary measure, anything less than 100% means failure


## DevOps Lead

You want somebody that likes to preach, s/he, like Saul of Tarsus, has had a road to Damascus conversion and now is a fervent preacher of the benefits of DevOps. 

S/he must make the pipelines as convoluted as possible, make unnecessary work for the team by always talking in absolutes,  pragmatism be dammed, unless, of course, convenient not to look bad in front of the rest of the team. 

S/he can be pragmatic when it suits, rest must be cleaner than clean and be prepared for sermons should this ad hoc pragmatism be challenged


## Project Manager

The ideal PM must ensure that the tech team is allowed to run wild with refactors and code quality tasks that only partially solve the problems and ultimately do not deliver any value to the customer, as they don't fully solve the problem.  

The PM must monitor Team Velocity like Oxygen levels on a Covid patient and ideally be so absent that 3/4 of the team don't even know what he's actual role is and have to wonder who the bloke obsessed with Velocity is.

## Product Owner

You want a product owner that assert his/her ownership over the project by ensuring that meaningless points get discussed ad-infinitum, while the important stuff is kicked into the long grass.

No point is too trivial to have a one hour meeting about where the motto for the attendance list is: the more the merrier.


## Project

The ideal project is one that aims to replace an existing product but will:

- lack feature parity, the more egregious the differential the better.
- be more expensive to extend and operate.
- lack in-house expertise
