If you ever put a job ad on LinkedIn or a similar platform, you've probably been inundated with applications, this is what happened to us recently.

One thing that struck me was the forgotten middle:  

1. I looked at a few of the first CVs that arrived.

1. I then devised a system to sort through the literally hundreds of CVs and using that system I did a sift

1. Most CVs after the sift were looked at because they trickled in rather than flooded in

So my takeway here is:

> The early bird gets the worm, the latecomer gets the glance â€” the middle just gets the algorithm.

tongue off cheek now please
