We recently had a job advert on LinkedIn.

We had 430 applicants before the job was closed 6 days later.

The job went live at 15:24 and a veritable flood of applications poured in.

We had 112 applications in the first 6 hours ðŸ™€ and close to 250 before the job ad had been live for a full day.

I started looking at the CVs in order of arrival but the first 3 were totally unsuited so I gave up and decided to wait.

Next time I sat down to look at the CVs I decided to randomly look a the CVs based on how peculiar the name sounded to me
