TL;DR; If applying to a job in LinkedIn, either be the first or one of the last.


We recently had a job advert on LinkedIn and we had 430 applicants before the job was closed 6 days later.

The job went live at 15:24 and a veritable flood of applications poured in.

We had 112 applications in the first 5 hours ðŸ™€ and close to 250 before the job ad had been live for a full day.

As the flood started, I think I looked at the third(fourth?) applicant, I missed the notifications for the first few, as it happens they were totally unsuitable but I did look at their CVs.

As the flood continued, I thought I'd have a look in the morning and then postponed again after going through a few CVs because I was a bit overwelmed  and I didn't really have a system.

Eventually I settled on a selection criteria for the by now 300+ CVs and went through the CVs that met them and here is where things get interesting:

By the time I had finished the first sift, there was but a trickle of CVs coming so I could actually take the time to look at them.

Thus it seems that you either want to be First or Last
