When I worked on the DWP account we once had a meeting with the chap that lead the account, where he proceeded to tell us that the profit margin wasn't great, what was the profit margin? 34%. Except that it wasn't because corporate take 21% of the profit and thus the account's actual margin was a measly 13%, far lower than the 16% averaged by our competitors at the time. I'm not sure of the actual size of the contract but we're probably talking ~ £1 Billion per year, so a 3% difference is ~ £30m.

A simplistic way to look a tthis, is that in order for the contract to benefit the tax payer, the DWP would have to be ~ 1/3 less efficient that EDS/HP (contract holder at the time), except that this would mean losing a lot of in-house knowledge and thus the efficiency difference would probably need to be higher (40%? 50%?) to account for the loss of in-house knowledge.

Another way of looking at this is that it would require from 3 DWP FTE to do the work of 2 EDS/HP FTE (under the dubious assumption of similar cost per FTE) up to 4 DWP FTE if we value the in-house knowledge very highly.

I have worked on the Civil Service recently, not the DWP mind, and I also have heard the stories of some civil servants getting away with doing nothing but the thing is, I have also heard similar stories about big companies and even small companies because a lot of the time people will work around a low/non performing teammate. Ultimately, getting rid of a low/non performing employee seems to depend on how busy management is.

One final comment, I don't know if the new breed of public sector consultancies (Methods, Made Tech, Automation Logic, etc ..) have similar profit margins but I would be suprised if they had significantly lower profit margins.
