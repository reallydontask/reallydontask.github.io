When I started working in the industry I was a Project Analyst, maybe it was Project Support Analyst, at a huge company (100k+ employees) in any case, this was little more than a glorified project manager assistant for recent graduates but I got a foot on the door and the pay wasn't too bad.

I was mainly trying to get the various techie teams to do stuff for the different projects and I encountered various attitudes, e.g. the helpers, would would go out of their way to help or the blockers that would go out of their way to block you but to the worst attitude was the checked out.  

These were people that would do their job to the strictest interpretation of their responsabilities. If the task fell within their responsabilities, they would do it efficiently but if it didn't, well you were truly on your own, because sometimes they wouldn't even help you to get help, it wasn't their responsbility, you see?

One example of this:

I had to source high spec PCs to allow testing of accessibility software, this was not a normal request so when it went through the normal channels I received a response along the lines of: We don't supply high spec PCs, which was curious as we already had one such high spec PC that had not been bougt at PC World.



I like to think of myself as a helper and disdain the people that had checked out 

I didn't check out when in 2008 as novice support developer I had to help a user login to our application that used windows integrated authentication and when I was talking to the client's help desk manager told me that I was trying to get her team to do my work by having the temerity of asking them to reset the Active Directory's account password for the affected user.


Or when in 2009 I kept fixing the same problem in the code of a highly paid consultant who was reusing the code from another project and could not understand that the particular piece of code was search entities it didn't have permssions to and that's why it was failing. And when, after the third or fourth time that this happened I fixed the issue and replied
that the solution was left as an exercise for the reader (of the email) and this created a massive kerfuffle, I didn't check out


Or when in 2010, still as support developer I kept asking the development team to ensure that trace logging was appropriate and easily toaggable to ensure that we could troubleshoot the application when it went live and oh surprise of surprises there was nothing there. No, We got here, we got here 2, does 100% not count


Or when in 2011 (2012?), a project manager had the temerity to say that: that was then, this is now, when asked why none of the things we had agreed the application should have in order to make it supportable would make it into the first release.


Or when in 2014, I spent a month? on a project with a massive scope creep due to the fact that nobody had bothered to read the NFRs the contract stipulated and that made our solution non-viable


Or in 2016 when we lost a customer because it was too expensive to implement redundancy in our infrastructure even though that was the first thing I said when I joined the company


On in 2017 when I had to ask the team to work overnight to meet a deadline that turned up to be later because sales had made a mistake.


Or in 2019 when I had to commute 2 hours each way daily so that I could collaborate with the team only to sit on the other side of the building and collaborate via Teams.
