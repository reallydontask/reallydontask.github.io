A tale of two companies and how they dealt with a potential employee's life.

## Company A

Sometime ago I had an interview with a small company. The interview, which was a competency/culture interview, went well and so I was invited to a final (technical) interview.

In my mind, the interview was scheduled for 11:00, possibly because that's what I said my availability was but in actuality it was booked for 10:30, so at around 10:45 I get a call from the recruiter asking me why I'm not at the interview and I reply that it doesn't start until 11:00, at this point I realized my mistake.

I explained the situation, namely that I got the timings wrong, to the recruiter and sent an email to the interview panel with the same explanation.

A few minutes later I get a call from the recruiter telling me that the company is no longer interested.

I was a bit annoyed at myself but also at the company and it also occurred to me that had I had a live incident or at least told them that I was in the middle of a live incident, they would have been more understanding so I decided to put my hypothesis to the test.

## Company B

So a few weeks after company A's fiasco I go through a couple of interviews until I interviewed with Company B, who on paper sounded good but in reality had some issues, so I decided to test my hypothesis with Company B.

So I got through the first interview and then for the second interview I just don't show up.  When the recruiter call comes I explain that I'm dealing with an incident.

As expected, the recruiter calls me the next day to rebook the interview


## Conclusion

I don't know, come up with better excuses next time?
