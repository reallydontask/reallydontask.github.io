A common misconception among Developers, Software Engineers, etc .. is that we get paid to write code. This could not be further from the truth.  We all get paid to deliver value, writing code is merely the means to deliver that value.

What does this mean in practice?

Well, I don't know, you work it out.

In practice this means that all that beautiful code you wrote might be a lot less valuable than the pile of crap the intern wrote over the summer and I think this is a humbling lesson to take home and internalize.
