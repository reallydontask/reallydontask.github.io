This is a screenshot from my spam folder from a few months ago (I'm a slow writer, OK), the only editing I have done is to remove the non-recruiter emails.

![Recruiters](../assets/recruiterspam.png)

I've attempted to summarize in a more digestible form:

| Position | Technology | Emails |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Devops/Platform/Cloud Engineer | AWS | 7
| Developer | Go        |1
| Developer | .NET      |8
| Developer | Python    |1
| Data/Solutions Architect | Azure    |2
| Support Analyst | Windows | 1
| Devops/Platform Engineer | GCP | 2
| Devops/Platform/Cloud Engineer | Azure | 1
| Server/Storage Engineer | Windows/Linux | 1 

You might be forgiven for thinking that I'm either a C# (do people say .NET, these days?) developer or an AWS DevOps Engineer but I'm an, mostly, Azure DevOps Engineer with a bit of experience in AWS who used to be a C# Developer and also a Solutions Architect, I think both Python and golang do feature in my CV too.


I really wish that they did more than just a keyword search on the CVs and stop spamming people with completely random and irrelevant positions.


Even more galling is the fact that the one time I got a very relevant email and responded recruiter it was simply ignored.
