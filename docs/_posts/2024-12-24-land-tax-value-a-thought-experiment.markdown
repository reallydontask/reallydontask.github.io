If you are not familiar with [Land Value Tax (LVT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax), it's:

> a levy on the value of land without regard to buildings, personal property and other improvements upon it.

In other words, the land gets taxed and not what's built on top of it.

It's often advocated as the solution to housing shortages, in fact the second question (at the time of writing) on the [georgism subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/georgism/wiki/faq) is:

> Won’t the site rent be passed on to the tenant?

The answer very much feels like begging the question: site will not be passed on to the tenant because site rent will not be passed on to the tenant.

Take for instance the first sentence:

> Site rent cannot be passed onto the tenant because the landlord is already charging the market price.

There is no qualification here, landlords **always** charge market price, there doesn't seem to be space for the army of accidental landlords that are quite happy with a tenant paying their mortgage and rather not risk losing a good tenant over £600 a year.

I'm not going to dissect every sentence of the answer but I thought it would be interesting to do a thought experiment into what would happen if LVT were introduced.
