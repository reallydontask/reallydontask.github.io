If you are not familiar with [Land Value Tax (LVT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax), it's:

> a levy on the value of land without regard to buildings, personal property and other improvements upon it.

In other words, the land gets taxed and not what's built on top of it.

It's often advocated as the solution to housing shortages, the thinking is that by taxing land, unused land might get assigned to more productive use, e.g. housing

One common criticism is that landlords will just pass the cost on to tenants, while this seems reasonable, it's normally shot down by LVT advocates who say that landlords already charge as much as the market will bear.

Is this a reasonable assertion?

Let's do a thought experiment.

The actual level of LVT matters, too low and it won't change anything, too high and it will be crippling, contested in court, etc.. but what is the effect on rent?

To simplify things in our thought experiment, a 10% LVT rate means that on a rent of £1000 per month, LVT would be £100 per month, 5% would be £50 per month and so on. This is because calculating actual LVT rates and their effects on rents will involve a lot of guess work and not really important for this thought experiment.
