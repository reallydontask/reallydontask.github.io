A few months back Netflix raised prices again so I decided to drop down to the Standard plan. This was at the beginning of the billing cycle so I just forgot about it.

Fast forward to a few days back, when I remembered the plan change and I realized that I hadn't noticed any change at all nor any noticeable decrease in quality when compared with Disney+, my little one loves to watch stuff from both, though to be fair I'm not sure how much of the kids stuff is 4K or indeed from Youtube, though I guess a similar caveat applies to content.

The fact that I've not noticed anything is in itself not that surprising, given what we know about screen resolution and watching distance (graph from RTINGS), which for us with a 55" TV watched from ~3 m away, suggests that we barely benefit from 1080, but, but I swear I can tell the difference ... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
