I'm starting a new job soon and I was having a conversation with my manager about my replacement and he mentioned that he wanted somebody that would stand up to the other chap in my team. I guess not very subtly implying that I hadn't and this got me thinking.

Was this true?

The truth is that it was true but I don't actually see this as anything negative.
