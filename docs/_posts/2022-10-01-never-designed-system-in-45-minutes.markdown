I used to think that system design type of interviews were good but lately I've changed my mind and in this post I will explain why.

A system design interview is one where you are given a set of requirements and need to design a system, in a whiteboard or online diagraming tool, that meets the requirement. 

## Irrelevant

The majority of people don't design systems from scratch, which is the only type of system design interview I've ever seen.  If you think about it, this isn't even that controversial, after all how often do companies design systems?
