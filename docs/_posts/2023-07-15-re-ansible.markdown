I recently started a new position as a team leader and received an email with an attachment and this subject:

> Re:Ansible

We don't use Ansible, we're not thinking of using Ansible and I certainly hadn't sent anybody an email with __Ansible__ as the subject, so this immediately screamed scam to me.

As it turns out, it was a recruiter telling me that Bob, not his real name, was available but alas he was interviewing so I had better get in touch post-haste if I was interested in interviewing Bob.

I just wondered who would use the services of somebody that has proven themselves to be deceitful in your very first interaction with them.

I'm sure that the recruiter would counter that he's not being deceitful simply trying to grab my attention, which he did, negatively.
