Let's say that we both live in the same city and that you are an average software engineer and that I am the [Lionel Messi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi), [Max Verstappen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen) and [Wayne Gretzky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky) rolled into one of social workers, who has a higher salary?

I know what you are thinking:

> A social worker couldn't do my job as a software engineer.

Well, could you do the job of a social worker?

I think it would be possible for a social worker to do the job of a software engineer and vice versa, it happens, with enough training and the right attitude it's possible for both to switch and become succesful.

To be clear, I'm not saying that competence doesn't matter vis-Ã -vis salary, after all a junior software engineer gets paid a lot less than a senior or a principal/staff engineer, I'm just saying that your choosen profession, and even sometimes industry, matter far more.

So next time you feel proud of your salary or indeed feel crap about your salary, just think that in all likelihood, this is mostly due to your profession rather than your competence.
