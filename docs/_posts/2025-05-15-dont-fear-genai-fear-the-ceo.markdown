I can't help but think that GenAI is Gen-Z's outsourcing moment, no doubt that time will prove me horribly wrong but bear with me.

In the late 90s, early 2000s outsourcing was all the rage. Why pay for expensive Western resources when you can get cheap developing country ones?

Well, to the surprise of the MBAgentsia, it turned out that the lower labour costs were not just a product of lower cost of living but also of lower quality, which coupled with cultural differences, communication issues as well as training and rework, frequently resulted in delays and little to no savings.

If you used GenAI to develop code your experience is likely to be shaped but what you are trying to achieve:

If you are working on a popular framework of a popular language you are probably having a good experience, sure it does need quite a bit of back and forth but it gets you there.

If on the other hand you use an obscure language or framework or even worse an obscure framework in an obscure language, GenAI is likely worse than useless to you.

So obviously the MBAgentsia think the former is representative and the savings are going to be immense, just like they were going to be with outsourcing.

The future will likely prove me wrong but we're not there yet
