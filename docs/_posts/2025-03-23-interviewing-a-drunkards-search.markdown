The [drunkard's search principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect) is a type of observational bias that occurs when people only search for something where it is easiest to look and think this is exactly what happens with interviewing.

I lead a small team of devops engineers and I'd say that these are the core skills for my job:

- Team management Skills
- Architecture (System Design) Skills
- Coding Skills
- Misc Tech Knowledge, e.g. cloud tech, CI/CD, etc .. 

# Team management Skills

The, seemingly, canonical way to probe into this set of skills is by using a [competency based recruitment process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competency-based_recruitment): 

> Competency-based recruitment is a process of recruitment based on the ability of candidates to produce anecdotes about their professional experience which can be used as evidence that the candidate has a given competency. 

There are many problem with these type of interviews both fundamentally and of execution:

- Good story tellers shine, regardless of competence.
- Overly reliant on previous experience, how is one meant to make the jump to a leadership position if one can't rely on past behaviours?
- Overly complicated scenarios to avoid prepared answers.

The main issue, however, is very similar to financial advice, namely:  

> Past performance is no guarantee of future results

In other words just because I told a good story about how I mended fences with a colleague for the good of the project/company, does not mean that I wouldn't actually torch a project and then swoop in to the rescue so I get the promotion rather than the project lead.

Here's your ðŸ”¦, no need to go back the park, hope it helps though.

# Architecture (System Design) Skills

The system design interview tends to go like this:

1. Design an MVP.
2. Change it to your ideal architecture.

This is to be done in 45 minutes, without access to any resources (product documentation, colleagues, dev team, etc ...) and there is no room for iteration or review, how could there be? You only have 45 minutes.

If this sounds like the exact opposite of how most people go about architecting a system, well that's because architecting a system is normally a very collaborative, iterative process that relies on research, proof of concept work and those pesky users and their awkward requirements.

I think we are going to need a bigger torch.

# Coding Skills

If you thought that the system design skill was really unrepresentative of how the actual process works, imagine that the output needed to be written down in vellum and you're not far off of what the whiteboard interview is.

We're not talking torches anymore, we're talking industrial lightning here.

There are other relatively common approches, e.g. pair coding or live coding, which generally answer the question: 

> Can you solve an arbitrary problem under an undeterminable (For the interviewer) amount of pressure in a short amount of time, generally, without access to the tools you are normally used to?

I know what you are thinking:

> This is why we do a take home test

I love these and think that followed with a walkthrough in a interview, they can provide a lot of useful information.  The main problem with these is that the time they take to complete, which might mean losing out on candidates who really can't dedicate another 4 hours for another take home test.

# Misc Tech Knowledge

Surprisingly enough trivia questions are seemingly still in vogue, e.g. what's the output of ```kubectl get nodes``` or what's the difference between ADD and COPY in docker file?

Defenders of this type of questions tend to argue that they are good proxies for experience in the area of the questions. I think this is generally not the case given that a lot of certifications test for this sort of knowledge. Furthermore, theoretical knowledge is relatively easy to achieve but there is no guarantees that the candidate will apply it.

In fairness, the questions around these areas tend to generally be more about experience and scenario based than outright trivia questions, which to me seems fairly sensible. Sure they might be harder to evaluate than trivia questions with, almost always, a right answer but I think they provide a better guide as to the competency of the candidate.
