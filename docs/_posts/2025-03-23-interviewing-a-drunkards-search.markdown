The [drunkard's search principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect) is a type of observational bias that occurs when people only search for something where it is easiest to look and think this is exactly what happens with interviewing.

I lead a small team of devops engineers and I'd say that these are the core skills for my job:

- Team management Skills
- Architecture (System Design) Skills
- Coding Skills
- Misc Tech Knowledge, e.g. cloud tech, CI/CD, etc .. 

# Team management Skills

The, seemingly, canonical way to probe into this set of skills is by using a [competency based recruitment process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competency-based_recruitment): 

> Competency-based recruitment is a process of recruitment based on the ability of candidates to produce anecdotes about their professional experience which can be used as evidence that the candidate has a given competency. 

There are many problem with these type of interviews both fundamentally and of execution:

- Good story tellers shine, regardless of competence.
- Overly reliant on previous experience, how is one meant to make the jump to a leadership position if one can't rely on past behaviours?
- Overly complicated scenarios to avoid prepared answers.

The main issue, however, is very similar to financial advice, namely:  

> Past performance is no guarantee of future results

I don't think this needs further explanation.

Here's your ðŸ”¦ hope it helps

# Architecture (System Design) Skills

The system design interview tends to go like this:

1. Design an MVP.
2. Change it to your ideal architecture.

This is to be done in 45 minutes, without access to any resources (product documentation, colleagues, dev team, etc ...) and there is no room for iteration or review, how could there be? You only have 45 minutes.

If this sounds like the exact opposite of how most people go about architecting a system, well that's because architecting a system is normally a very collaborative, iterative process that relies on research, proof of concept work and those pesky users and their awkward requirements.

I think we are going to need a bigger torch.

# Coding Skills

If you thought that the system design skill was really unrepresentative of how the actual process works, imagine that the output needed to be written down in pen and paper and you're not far off of what the whiteboard interview is, which to be fair its point is more a test of whether you've done the leet question grind than anything else.
