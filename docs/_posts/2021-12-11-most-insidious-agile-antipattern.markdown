# The Most Insidious Agile Anti-Pattern

 I have given up on getting annoyed at people using _begging the question_ to mean _raises the question_ rather than its original meaning of a logical fallacy also known as [petitio principii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question) and thus I make no apology for equating agile with scrum, which seems to be what most people mean when they say agile  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## For the benefit of ...

This anti-pattern is most obvious in the stand up, which is designed to ensure that every team member updates the team on progress and or issues. 

This is very much designed to help the scrum master keep track of what everybody is up to, which is fine as goals go, however this is not free of cost. The most obvious cost is the context switching required after the stand up as this is a meeting where all the team members are expected. Ideally, the stand-up happens before the start of the day or maybe at the end of the day, but unless you force a 9-5 on everybody, you can see how the stand up might fall inside work time rather than the beginning or the end. 

There is also the simple fact that team members rarely have a keen, or indeed any, interest in what the rest of the team is doing. To be clear sometimes team members are waiting on each other, but it seems to me that waiting a full day for an update might not be the most efficient use of time, to say nothing of the fact that if this happens regularly, you probably need to think more about how you are doing your scheduling.

You might think that updates help with PR reviews and while it's true that sometimes they do, e.g. somebody might comment on the stand up how they tried the obvious way to solve a problem but it didn't work so they went with a convoluted solution, this is rarely the case


but stop and think for a minute and you realize that the costs imposed by the stand up are probably

 but there are a lot of costs to the team but it's normally done synchronously, which forces people to stop what they are doing, thus imposing a cognitive cost. 

## Not just the stand up

You might have read thus far and thought that by and large I was right but it's only the stand-up, only 15 minutes a day, probably not a huge deal, but this anti-pattern doesn't stop here.

For instance the planning session is another one that's of little benefit to the team at large.

The purpose of this meeting is to decide what is worked on for the next sprint and this is normally done by estimating the product backlog items (PBIs) in the backlog against the team's capacity, however there is a bit of quirk, which is that the estimating units are arbitrary as if this wasn't bad enough, there are no real life consequences for not delivering the PBIs in the sprint, they just get moved into the next sprint and maybe capacity is reduced next time, but remember that all of this is arbitrary, my five ICs team capacity of 40 might be the capacity of a single IC in your team because the measures are arbitrary and if there are no real life consequences then why bother with this?

If you are thinking that this where PBIs are prioritized, that's the wrong answer, they should be prioritized already in the backlog and the relationship between the PBIs captured in the PBIs themselves, which most planning software deals with.

Even the retrospective can fall into this anti-pattern in what would likely be one of the most useful additions to the development process, how you might ask?  This happens when the scrum master is unwilling or unable to address the issues raised by the team.
