I thought it would be a cool to have a blog on the nequalsone.com domain, as all the posts that I write will almost certainly have a single datapoint, namely me and thus n = 1 seems very appropriate.

Alas, it looks like the domain is taken and will cost $2800 to acquire, which is way more than I'm willing to spend on a domain, hence you get the Spanish version, namely eneigualauno.com.
