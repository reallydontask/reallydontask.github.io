It's an open secret in the IT industry that interviewing is broken with interviews that bear no resemble to the actual work down to no even using a computer [sic.] (leet code), unreasonable, mostly uncompensated, time commitments (take home projects) or interviews that tests your ability to tell a good story for increasingly unusual scenarios (behavioural interviews) or my personal favourite, where one is expected to design an ever increasingly complex architecture in 45 minutes with zero or minimal feedback (system design)

Perhaps unsurprisingly all of those styles of interviews and many others have their defenders, which tend to be based either on self-interest, e.g. somebody who has a lot of time and enjoys a challenge will likely defend take home projects or based on correlations, e.g. All our top performers have always managed to solve leet hard problems during the interview.

The self-interested engineer is easy to understand but the manager/exec that relies on correlation is significantly harder to understand because it's interviewing being broken is an open secret, there is no secret at all that measure engineer performance is a notoriously difficult endeavour. Some attempts rely on easily gameable metrics: LOCs or its modern equivalents like Story Points or merged commits, while others use complex formulas or frameworks like DORA or SPACE.
